## Aim 

To provide a rapid interim summary of juvenile salmon migration characteristics and oceanographic conditions in the Discovery Islands and northern Strait of Georgia region in British Columbia, Canada. 

## Background

The Hakai Institute Juvenile Salmon Program was launched in the spring of 2015. For a complete background including methods see [Hunt et al. 2018](https://npafc.org/wp-content/uploads/Public-Documents/2018/1788Canada.pdf). The program operates in the Discovery Islands (Figure 1) and thus provides information on the health of juvenile salmon after passage through: 

1) Strait of Georgia – stratified high plankton biomass zone; and 

2) Discovery Islands – highly-mixed low-plankton-biomass zone, and area of, historically, high potential for wild-farmed fish interactions.

## Program Objectives

1) Determine migration timing and relative abundance; 

2) Map migration habitat - oceanographic conditions along the migration route;

3) Understand the dynamics of the plankton food-webs that underpin juvenile salmon growth and health;

4) Understand parasite and pathogen infection dynamics and their impact on juvenile salmon growth and health.

## Key Parameters Reported

* Catch Statistics and Migration Timing
* Lengths
* Parasite Presence
* Ocean Temperatures

The following plots are subject to change as the underlying data are preliminary and subject to further quality assurance. The Hakai Institute embraces an "Open Science Policy"; to that end you can access the time series data used in this report at http://dx.doi.org/10.21966/1.566666.

## Highlights

* Peak sockeye migration timing was up to two weeks later than in previous years
* Sockeye catch abundance was low compared to all other years
* Sea lice prevalence was lower on all species of salmon observed in this year compared to 2021
