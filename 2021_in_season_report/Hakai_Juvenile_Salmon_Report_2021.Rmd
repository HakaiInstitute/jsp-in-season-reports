## Aim 

To provide a seasonal summary of juvenile salmon migration characteristics and oceanographic conditions in the Discovery Islands and northern Strait of Georgia region in British Columbia, Canada. 

## Background

The Hakai Institute Juvenile Salmon Program was launched in the spring of 2015. The program operates in the Discovery Islands (Figure 1) and thus provides information on the health of juvenile salmon after passage through: 

1) Strait of Georgia – stratified high plankton biomass zone; and 

2) Discovery Islands – highly-mixed low-plankton-biomass zone, and area of, historically, high potential for wild-farmed fish interactions.

## Program Objectives

1) Determine migration timing and relative abundance; 

2) Map migration habitat - oceanographic conditions along the migration route;

3) Understand the dynamics of the plankton food-webs that underpin juvenile salmon growth and health;

4) Understand parasite and pathogen infection dynamics and their impact on juvenile salmon growth and health.

## Key Parameters Reported

* Catch Statistics and Migration Timing
* Lengths
* Parasite Presence
* Ocean Temperatures

The following plots are subject to change as the underlying data are preliminary and subject to further quality assurance.

The Hakai Institute embraces an "Open Science Policy"; to that end you can access the time series data used in this report at http://dx.doi.org/10.21966/1.566666.

## Highlights

* Sockeye migration timing was up to a week later than in previous years
* Sockeye catch abundance is low compared to all other years
* Sea lice prevalence is lower on all species of salmon observed in this year compared to 2020
