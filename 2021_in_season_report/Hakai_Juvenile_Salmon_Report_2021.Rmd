## Aim 

To provide in-season summaries of juvenile salmon migration characteristics and oceanographic conditions in the northern Strait of Georgia region in British Columbia, Canada. 

## Background

The Hakai Institute Juvenile Salmon Program was launched in the spring of 2015 in a collaborative partnership with UBC, SFU, University of Toronto, Salmon Coast Field Station, Pacific Salmon Foundation, and Fisheries and Oceans Canada. As of 2021, the program operates in the Discovery Islands (Figure 1) and thus provides information on the health of juvenile salmon after passage through: 

1) Strait of Georgia – stratified high plankton biomass zone; and 

2) Discovery Islands – highly-mixed low-plankton-biomass zone, and area of high wild-farmed fish interactions.

## Program Objectives

1) Determine migration timing and pathways; 

2) Migration habitat mapping - oceanographic conditions along the migration route;

3) Understand the dynamics of the plankton food-webs that underpin juvenile salmon growth and
health;

4) Understand parasite and pathogen infection dynamics and their impact on juvenile salmon growth and
health.

## Key Parameters Reported

* Catch Statistics
* Lengths
* Parasite Presence
* Oceanographic Conditions

The following plots are subject to change as the underlying data are preliminary and subject to further quality assurance.

We are endeavouring to provide useful information for the entire salmon research community. As such we welcome any feedback. Please direct questions or comments to Brian Hunt (B.Hunt@oceans.ubc.ca), Tim van der Stap (Tim.vanderstap@hakai.org), Krystal Bachen (Krystal.Bachen@hakai.org), and/or Brett Johnson (Brett.Johnson@hakai.org). 

The Hakai Institute embraces an "Open Science Policy"; to that end you can review, make suggestions or report issues with the R code written to produce this report by visiting https://github.com/HakaiInstitute/jsp-in-season-reports

## Highlights

* The first sockeye recorded in the Discovery Islands was May 25th -- several days later than in all previous sampling years. 
* The majority of sockeye caught were infected with at least one sea-louse. Additionally, numerous juvenile, attached sea-lice were observed on the sockeye.
* Spring ocean temperatures are colder than the average over the past five years, but warmer during the month of June.
